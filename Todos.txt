    BUILDER CLASSES FOR REBRICKABLE CONTENT:

    1. Builder class for the Theme.
        a. user makes a get request for all themes at start.
            // https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/lego/themes/
        b. theme data comes back and is built into "Theme" objects and rendered to the DOM.
        c. User selects a particular theme, which then triggers another get request for all kits of that theme:
            // https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/lego/sets/?theme_id=12
        d. kit data are returned and are again built into "Kit" objects and rendered to the DOM.
        e. User clicks on a "select" button, which adds the selected "Kit" object to the selections array
        f. User clicks on a "Submit" button, which sends a "POST" request to the local API <selections#create>.
            // http://localhost:3001/selections
        g. Create action populates database with the selections to the current_user. It then renders back all selections.
        h. React rebuilds the user's selections page with the updated selections.      
        
          
    2. :) Builder class for the kit.
